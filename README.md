# About the Project
This mini project was to help practice what I have learnt. I tried to do a project to get back to using JavaScript. 

It inludes some basic input functionality which returns your age based on your date of birth. The current date is displayed dynamically each time a user would log in. 

## Things I learnt:
- Using CSS Grid for layouts & combining Grid with Flexbox 
- Learnt how to manipulate the new Date() method in JavaScript
- Learnt that it is not so much about knowing th syntax (which is important) but also knowing what code to write
